            <p><a href="https://github.com/DGolubets/k8s-managed-node-pool">Managed K8s node pool operator</a> is what I've been working on lately in my spare time. Though the motivation for that comes from my job use case.</p>
<p>We use Digital Ocean managed kubernetes at work.
It works great, and it's cheaper than alternatives.
But there is one limitation they have on their node pools: you can't auto-scale them to zero.</p>
<p>That's usually not a problem at all. For normal work pools.
But sometimes I need to run a Spark job, on beefy, expensive droplets.
You can see where that's going.</p>
<p>At first I used to create and destoy that node pool manually.
I quickly discovered that I often forget to shut it down.
Even though autoscaled to 1, that one pod would run and eat some money.</p>
<p>Then I came up with Python code that would create and destory the pool automatically when Spark app was starting or terminating. That worked much better. Though not perfect. If I wanted to apply a fix to the app I had to restart it and in it's turn that would recreate the pool, which takes time, unnecessarily.</p>
<p>I finally decided to solve it once and for all.
With a custom K8s operator.</p>

            <p>I've been working on a little pet project recently - a custom K8s operator.
I had to put something into "API group" there.. and I've come up with nothing better than my Github Pages URL.
Well, it's unique, so why not.</p>
<p>But what if somebody decides to actually open it..
I better put something there.
Something as simple as a blog.</p>
<p>I plan to use this as an index and update feed of any OSS projects I work on.
And maybe some occasional thoughts if I feel like it.</p>
