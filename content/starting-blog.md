I've been working on a little pet project recently - a custom K8s operator.
I had to put something into "API group" there.. and I've come up with nothing better than my Github Pages URL.
Well, it's unique, so why not.

But what if somebody decides to actually open it..
I better put something there.
Something as simple as a blog.

I plan to use this as an index and update feed of any OSS projects I work on.
And maybe some occasional thoughts if I feel like it.
